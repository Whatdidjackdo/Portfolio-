A lasting effect I have with Walter Benjamin's The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction was when a classmate of mine drew on a photo of Walter Benjamin to make it look like he had tattoos on his face like a sound cloud rapper, and by classmate saying Walter would of proved of this as I am reproducing his photo with new modern meaning. Ever continuing the update of technological advancement and what it can do to create new meaning with art and media in reproduction uses. 
The opportunity to reproduce media with a connection to the original to then new meaning creates an opportunity to voice opinions and gather attention from the prior media's recognition to viewers. Copying has been done throughout history, from etching and engraving in woodcut to today, in a command prompt, to copy an art style and generate a new digital rendering. 
Benjamin understood the potential in reproduction in its early media form, seeing that “the eye perceives more than the hand can draw,” so visual media can get across better and faster. Getting strongly in a message as political propaganda has throughout history, and it note by Benjamin as “reproduced pieces of work can cause the most profound change and their impact on the public” and very much as an image staying in our mind when we think of a topic when we have seen that image multiple times.  
There are some limits, as Benjamin states about Aura, that reproduction work “lacks the original’s presence of time in space it was created in” being of the original art but not the complete same in significance as the artwork. A picture of the Mona Lisa is not the same as the painting of the Mona Lisa. Benjamin emphasizes the importance of “presence” to the original artwork as the “prerequisite of authenticity. Without aura, the reproduction is a half full purpose to represent the art, not art outside its reflections as one. Reproduction helps art be seen and is easier to show a reprinted photo of a statue than actually having to move the statue around the world, a different interaction than the real work, but the meaning of it can be seen and shared. 
New methods of technical reproduction of a work of art, can transform its nature as the age of mechanical reproduction separates art from its basis in cult, as the semblance disappears with a new reaction by viewers.

“Today the cult value would seem to demand that the work of art remain hidden. Certain statues of gods are accessible only to the priest in the cella; certain Madonnas remain covered nearly all year round; certain sculptures on medieval cathedrals are invisible to the spectator on ground level.”

Consumption of media meets a need to entertain by reproducing to get the message or story in a film that holds weight to ideas and propaganda as a tool to use and get out to people in an effective media use. Technique use is almost a sport of witness to its objectives, a Social significance, and as an art form.. Like an actor on screen, captured to be facing the public as their personality is spelled to the viewer. A film performing well to a viewer, Benjamin believes, is a state of distraction, when a film with its shock effect meets this mode of reception halfway, as the public is an examiner of the story and life captured and copied to be seen. 

“I can no longer think what I want to think. My thoughts have been replaced by moving images" The spectator's process of association in view of these images is indeed interrupted by their constant, sudden change. constitutes the shock effect of the film, which, like all shocks, should be cushioned by heightened presence of mind.” (Benjamin)
 Benjamin views with governing control in mass moment is fully in effect with war as it mobilizes all to technical resources while maintaining the property system.  Benjamin points out fascism in mass movement and media. I see this connection from art being owned privately by kings and churches, which made art inaccessible to the poor class. In what I believe Benjamin relates to that the former control was that of a dictatorial power of suppressing the art form in a controlled society. The status of art then changed with mass production and reproduction of art by duplication reprinting art to be able to be seen outside its original piece and available to the public.
