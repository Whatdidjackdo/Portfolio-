* Theory: Introduction & Randomness10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10, by Nick Montfort et al, 2013


     Tech and how we use it has advanced from its release to the public, but rarely do we think about tech in large technical terms, tech has stayed the same. For advancement and access to opportunities in the sciences, arts, and engineering with tech, an understanding of the software is required for that building progression. The best way is to start with getting to know the background and informative history to gear the language and descriptions, and then take part in the development of the techno culture. Build and witness a user create 

A good balance of creation needs a bit of randomness to be something new and unlike before, a new, unexpected element is needed.

10 Prints by Nick Montfort chapter on randomness explores the role of randomness in computing and beyond in games, literature, the arts, and realms of culture. Since randomness is coded an occurrence with hap, the root of happy, Montfort says randomness might be a root meaning in connected etymology. Before science and mathematics predicted randomness was seen as a nightmare in less informed times. Practice acts of kindness, fears of random acts of violence have molded the association with the world to be scaled action and extreme depending on the relation and the surroundings. Random encounter is something we all can relate to in life, taking a step in the world or an unfamiliar area, a lot more to the experience of a random encounter, not the same as one in Dungeons and Dragons, but a random one at that. Science has only recently found an appropriate association and use of the word randomness when science aspires for an absolute meaning and answers. Words in computing have different uses meaning Print in computing is a command word to press to see a random figure move across the screen, an echo of the printing press still connected to modern technology in a different way, more honored and remembered. Randomness is in our lives from kids to adults, calculating or not thinking before taking a chance, and we deal with choosing with chance is a daily experience and modern intake as we try to tame it with data, learning, and optics. Interact with games of chance in human games we play in competitive thrill upon skill, mimicking, and disruption of control with rules and class setting by way of unpredictable outcomes will “fade smile upon the player” (Montfort)

To a gambler, it is “too diverse to become boring 

An interplay between pleasure and pain with a valued compression of time. Walter Benjamin is mentioned in the writing that the greater the aspect of chance in a game, the faster it elapses.

Randomness in social settings by formal indeterminacy allotment statistical methods, social indeterminacy, the importance of knowing someone's point of view to call or make a bluff, performative indeterminacy, the unreliability of one's own or another's actions, and fourth, Malaby's skepticism about fairness and legitimacy and rules. How one thinks can also reveal about them selfs in layers of randomness.



"God does not play dice with the universe."



Randomness found in a computer's programming echoes Malaby's idea of cosmological indeterminacy. Randomness operations are necessary to daily life for live to move it itself is framed as fixed, repeatable, and knowable to predict randomness. Unseen and shocking like art's wild sculpting or relating is the randomness is its significance, and the push to see it.  Today I think about randomness with algorithms on social media as it will find patterns amongst random data to search and played media to organize its own media playlist to present and hold your attention in an endless feed of random but connected allowing the viewer to media. From screensavers, password generators, to Ms. Pac-Man, randomness is covered in a lot of digital spaces.

  Evolution of motion imagery
Created visual engagement of photoplays striking human emotion by creating suspense by cutting between two actions into visual means by mood relation reaction by the series in the timeline establishes. Storytelling is spectacle presentation crafted by light processing darkness range, centering subject by focus and close-ups, scene building, montage, and emotional relation by timing in the assembly and properties of film. We engage film to give us something by entertainment and feeling by seeing and understanding people perform life in struggle and excitement at presentation level. Projecting and hold on an audience is a persuasive power. Janet Murray discuss films capturing tool in  “Hamlet on the Holodeck” and how 100 years later that tool is in our hands with the internet and digital technology. Electronic narrative and possibilities has advanced in ability far from  in what Murray was marveling digital technology doing in 1997 compared to media projections she was comparing of past projection of media in classic novels. The engagement has evolved but Murray points out the formulations that defined a film by theater show principles applied to photo play characteristics still guide media today, The aspects of the past stage performances are development stages that are formats from earlier technologies. Presentation view in analog timeline was taken and heighten to new visions being able to rearrange in possibilities with digital manipulation  computing space to view multiple images and moving video freely from order and choice of design. New Technology doesn’t always create impressive story, Murry references a Web show being exciting because it is online with buttons to active a script to see the acted dialog but in the quality is vivid in comparison of the rich feeling of live theater, an almost uncanny valley. Murry talks about “our clicking would then be motivated not by curiosity about the media objects and coming in any time in the story and review important past events as if pausing to google search a detail in the show that grabbed an attention. Interaction of computers can fool us into speaking as live like qualities but what misses is the nuance of understanding someone and not needing them to spell out clarity and issue of awareness limits with computer life like interlace with the Eliza and Teletype programs. Created to be so much like an actual person that we would no longer be able to tell when we were talking to a computer and when to a human being, effecting to is power seen todo with people confine in chatgpt but now knowing its not
Really but infectious to its response like its a human. Weizenbaum a creator of machines was concerted and wrote a book warning of the dangers of attributing human thought to machines. Text has a simpler path to copying a human  but to convince and mistake film images for the real world is more workin manipulation  but easily just as effective. Properties the enforce this environment is 
procedural in operation to be interactive and  want users to explore with it and make the experience extensive. Starting the medium to function with algorithms and heuristics by use of keywords to strike response and commands. Taking response answers and reverting them filling X variable with the answer in response creating a coherent dramatic dialogue.
Working because the program like computers is set up to be procedural and participatory. Creating program system results by coded if statements and processes that were more “conversational structure between the programmer and the program”. In the example of a game having to repeat mistakes and forcing the player to find the right way it is in Murrays interesting point that In a way, the computer was programming the player.

A key to compelling storytelling in a participatory medium lies in scripting the viewer to interact, and challenge by invent scripts formulaic enough to be easily grasped and responded to.The digital creation opens room for showing space and scale where print could only describe it. By power of the computers graphics and ram capability a display of maps, pictures, and three-dimensional models can be projected. Verify virtual space to another by action of retracing digital  steps. In digital projections like a game places have objective reality can to use and move throw feeling real and interaction has a much more concrete feeling on the screen “displaying a story that is also a place”.

Mouse-clicking through the mind of the insomniac is like a walk through a labyrinth. a maze mimics the physical tossing and turning
dead-end thinking of a person unable to fall asleep. 

A story navigation of virtual space but shaped shaped into a dramatic enactment of the plot for player control. The interaction is only as good as the installed knowledge “a huge capacity of electronic media is the encyclopedic expectation in a digital program to interact by. Thus to represent the world with both scope and particularity by window of a digital space. Allowing fandom to flourish and share in information published online to access.   

“The computer has developed during this time into a versatile tool for modeling systems that reflect our ideas about how the world is organized.” For more coverage and power in manipulation to tell stories that give us greater freedom and understanding to the world.
