* Theory: Introduction & Randomness10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10, by Nick Montfort et al, 2013


     Tech and how we use it has advanced from its release to the public, but rarely do we think about tech in large technical terms, tech has stayed the same. For advancement and access to opportunities in the sciences, arts, and engineering with tech, an understanding of the software is required for that building progression. The best way is to start with getting to know the background and informative history to gear the language and descriptions, and then take part in the development of the techno culture. Build and witness a user create 

A good balance of creation needs a bit of randomness to be something new and unlike before, a new, unexpected element is needed.

10 Prints by Nick Montfort chapter on randomness explores the role of randomness in computing and beyond in games, literature, the arts, and realms of culture. Since randomness is coded an occurrence with hap, the root of happy, Montfort says randomness might be a root meaning in connected etymology. Before science and mathematics predicted randomness was seen as a nightmare in less informed times. Practice acts of kindness, fears of random acts of violence have molded the association with the world to be scaled action and extreme depending on the relation and the surroundings. Random encounter is something we all can relate to in life, taking a step in the world or an unfamiliar area, a lot more to the experience of a random encounter, not the same as one in Dungeons and Dragons, but a random one at that. Science has only recently found an appropriate association and use of the word randomness when science aspires for an absolute meaning and answers. Words in computing have different uses meaning Print in computing is a command word to press to see a random figure move across the screen, an echo of the printing press still connected to modern technology in a different way, more honored and remembered. Randomness is in our lives from kids to adults, calculating or not thinking before taking a chance, and we deal with choosing with chance is a daily experience and modern intake as we try to tame it with data, learning, and optics. Interact with games of chance in human games we play in competitive thrill upon skill, mimicking, and disruption of control with rules and class setting by way of unpredictable outcomes will “fade smile upon the player” (Montfort)

To a gambler, it is “too diverse to become boring 

An interplay between pleasure and pain with a valued compression of time. Walter Benjamin is mentioned in the writing that the greater the aspect of chance in a game, the faster it elapses.

Randomness in social settings by formal indeterminacy allotment statistical methods, social indeterminacy, the importance of knowing someone's point of view to call or make a bluff, performative indeterminacy, the unreliability of one's own or another's actions, and fourth, Malaby's skepticism about fairness and legitimacy and rules. How one thinks can also reveal about them selfs in layers of randomness.



"God does not play dice with the universe."



Randomness found in a computer's programming echoes Malaby's idea of cosmological indeterminacy. Randomness operations are necessary to daily life for live to move it itself is framed as fixed, repeatable, and knowable to predict randomness. Unseen and shocking like art's wild sculpting or relating is the randomness is its significance, and the push to see it.  Today I think about randomness with algorithms on social media as it will find patterns amongst random data to search and played media to organize its own media playlist to present and hold your attention in an endless feed of random but connected allowing the viewer to media. From screensavers, password generators, to Ms. Pac-Man, randomness is covered in a lot of digital spaces.
