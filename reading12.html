     GLITCH FEMINISM A Manifesto by LEGACY RUSSELL 
     Glitches undetectable till they reveal themselves, 
     altering and lowering the quality and seamless illusion of life captured in a video or image. 
     The few times the human side of tech comes to view, showing the flaw possibility to digital rendering interruptions and numbers 
     computing not always outputting correctly. Most people don’t know how a computer works or why, but they know when they’ve experienced 
     a glitch in their digital operation expectations, interrupted and flawed results. Processing glitch and algorithm glitch c
     lash with the manual when trying to input and auto fill data, tries to answer what it thinks best as opposed to a manual correct input, 
     these are areas where the data can be a wrong intention to the situation needed. Fresh learning for the data or more manual input could
     be the answer. banally m complicit with the individual taking and personal task of doing in our control in exchange for our own personal 
     data taken for auto operation. Digital platforms have an online identity from our online activity, with frequent best results to say
     the platform knows us better than we know ourselves, suggesting and choosing how we are to be portrayed and giving to marketing 
     and advertising. Want vs business priorities for sales. The use of computers became part of human activity and action. 
     The problem, error, and glitch with computers happened and named for the extended experience to describe random real 
     problems to happen. There's a power and satisfaction in being understood to experience and what you felt, and with digital interaction,
     Russel adds to this satisfaction as “where people assume if they can find a word to describe something, that this is the beginning of
     controlling it,” it being the error, the glitch to the problem. Digital programs are assigned action to given results from the start 
     by text responses written in with no area for full face value visual and audio, and previous interactions with others to base information 
     on someone. Russel zones jn the flaw of fitting someone into a box that the digital program gives based on its limited given options. 
     Some programs are flawed in not updating with the times, flawed in not thinking ahead, or in the biases of their creators. 
     I sometimes think the creators know the code, not the lives they dont live, and create an inability to identify someone. 
     The downside of one person trying to do it all, mathematical program design, and user human experience interface. 
     In a reverse control on this issue of assessment labeling, Russel talks about maybe what was and was not visible there would help me 
     circumnavigate and escape the "suffering that comes from the condition of being addressable," of being called, defined, 
     named in identity perception control. Humans have a choice in being themselves by creating a split from the original entity. 
     Digital programs don't have this opportunity or evolve into their action. Something that can greatly depict a person and their 
     digital identity can't evolve like a person can be programmed to represent. Russell advocates a feminist making theory to have a 
     service of healing and creation, rather than in the service of destruction." By Conversely, cárdenas's "stitch" using one entity 
     to connect two formerly separate entities," that is better for its "less violent than the cut" as it "intends to join,”
     I see Russell's words alined to the feeling that our digital representation to user could benefit to A breaking and healing developing 
     function detailed by the digital as performative action to develop and evolve by the user. Russel's writing critiques digital organization
     and tech being mainly white and straight in perspective, this could be the eye of the beholder or profit focus to market, but the online space 
     goes beyond the market sale of the exchange, it's a human connection experience, people care how their identity is seen to be connected with.
