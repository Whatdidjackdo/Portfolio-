     Reading 
Donna Haraway’s A Cyborg Manifesto makes the viewer think about their place within and amongst society. Referencing an integrated Circuit, a Common Language for Women in our society that is symbolized and related as to a cyborg being like the rest but different, split into views and consideration to life. Pointing questions to what aspects humans are faithful to feminism, socialism, and materialism. Reacting and writing to the treatment of women and feminist ideals as tech and cyborg identity with statements like 
“intimacy and with a power that was not generated in the history of sexuality” and “Cyborg replication is uncoupled from organic reproduction”. 
Haraway’s ideals of a cyborg gives life a purpose, an existence of ontology; it gives politics and a condensed image of both imagination and material reality.

The viewpoint also holds that a cyborg goes against  ‘Western’ science and politics,”—turning a path outside of racist, male-dominant capitalism; and self-progress. Differences could arise with conflicting viewpoints in humans vs cyborgs as organisms and machines could be a border war. 
Identity in social groups and lifestyles is what seems to be the call for important recognition of risk to livelihood. Haraway has great word association and making the viewer see connections. She is blending with examples as “attempting to heal the terrible cleavages of gender in an oral symbiotic utopia or post-oedipal apocalypse,” using a common body descriptive world in use for surface issues that strike today with gender, but could be healed tomorrow.
The cyborg is a creature in a post-gender world;  the fabrication of a heterosexual mate, 

Not really fully a human and not really a mechanical robot, a “ghost in the machine,”  a relation between materialism and idealism described in purpose as spirit or history, according to following with autonomous life. The lives of women throughout time have been given less opportunity from “gender formation” and “domination of woman/nature”. It seems Haraway sees an opportunity to take steps forward from that with the idea of a Cyborg as a technological move forward for a revolution of social relations. Who cyborgs will be is a radical question; the answers are a matter of survival. Cyborgs having life reasoning to decide for their own and a mechanical body outside of human limitations opens who a cyborg is and will by a radical question; by a matter of survival affecting their choices. 

Being Different is a cyborg 
They are the eyes of man, and reaction by hacking and rewriting identity.
