   Reading Response 7
Theory: Chapters 1 & 2 from The Electronic Disturbance by CAE, 1994


The electronic disturbance by Critical Art Ensemble CAE Artists working together as a group for 25 years. Formed in 1987 in Tallahassee, Florida, with a focus on the exploration of the intersections between art, critical theory,
technology, and political activism. Members: Steve Kurtz, Steve Barnes, Dorian Burr, Beverly Schlee, and Hope Kurtz. Their group artwork in biotech, tactical media installations, printed material, and videos resists authoritarian aspects of culture and injustice in capitalism, as well as to disrupt and interfere with the flow of it. 

The Electronic Disturbance (1994), talks about a revolution of Tech, a time of access to users being able to receive and send information in 1994. Early server access to the internet with AOL for consumers. The CAE presented it as a virtual geography, where a user can access political and cultural resistance by one asserting themselves in the electronic space.

The first chapter displays nice symbolic passages with two different versions on the top and bottom of the page as a before and after options as an advancement to best connect with audiences, by word choice, font, and size, with the flowery poetic language often used to describe in media theory writing.

As with the vision description referenced in chapter 1, of a plane, of the sun and all of the stars with earth and sea, and all living things as if exhibited upon a transparent globe. As if saying A future prediction of abilities with the internet of live streaming and video calls, and possibly Google Earth, seeing anywhere.

The reading motivates pro reasons to structure and organize, but also inspires the reader that disrupting power does not need to be complex to produce disturbances. The uses of technology give that access but also distraction as speed and absence into the digital space, and todo effective work also requires staying still and present on a computer and desk set up as CAE sees it, a Collide in hyperreality. The internet’s access to use as a tool must hold the user in time and place relating to CAE’s non location with repetitive action on the computer it prevents those caught in lock-down and tape loop with their actions to be heard but not seeing or feeling psychical effect tor change so they repeat in the digital space lie today with posting on forums and online social media in a cycle of their interest as a keyboard town cryers.

Information holds power, as “the nomad is free to wander the electronic net”, they are able to “cross national boundaries with minimal resistance from national control”, seeing the internet as an equality opportunity and optimism for the future. Citizens aren’t equal to the output power of companies and the government, but the ability to express an opinion at a valuable broadcast range of connected followers is now a current available tool, and be your suaveness, you could access a large audience and swaying control of influence in opinion by range of accessible by talent and skill at social media.  


"If we have nothing, at least we have the internet", living in a pod, but a live in VR.


Will the future hold restrictions in living cost and property governement or corporate-owned reusing us to rented out small living, and restrictions dictation by social credit by your internet activity, and how it could restrict living and options to people. There is a benefit to making people work for a standard status set by power entities, not wanting them to get out and control their own life options. A good media hook can convince anyone on a message. An effective image campaign can make people believe in an idea as a siding view for good or create fear from it.

Counting a negative measure takes response action following a free liberty to comment and speak voice to as “freedom is enhanced for those participating in the project.” Its strength is apparent and seen by those who take part and make use of it. With respect to CAE, mentioning that any action in response is a gamble of effectiveness and could face consequences. 

Though it shouldn’t make you quit, as Steve Barnes said in a talk “The Worst kind of censorship is self-censorship, stopping yourself before you even try thinking it's impossible”.
