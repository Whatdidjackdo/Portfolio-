      Do digital users prioritize status in judging hierarchy in their use of image and digital interaction? Where does the approval land? Is it subconscious to critical thought yet registered and known on how to answer if questioned? 

Hito Steyerl points in the area that our connected communication integration by digital imagery ranges in the class of Rich imagery of standard and approval for use in following corrections nd expectation in contrast to the poor image being defective in perfection value to standard but not in creative use and artistic choice in meaning by visual style. Digital imagery is integrated by society's use in community interface of feed consumption of media. That consumption is supplied, uploaded and refreshed with new entries every second. From capital advertisement or user posting as self-offering in self-display, it can accelerate forward in use or denied by rules of image approval, or deteriorate value depending on the update evolution standards and phasing out the unapproved. 


The internet and social media would not be the same without images to amply subject and engagement online. So much of the interaction is with images “ripped, remixed, copied, pasted” and posted from selected and approved images for our meaning of image communication in online posting with digital images. Like beauty standards and self-image, we want our images to reflect good quality if it’s of ourselves or the communication in that image to be delivered correctly and clear. When it cant be clear, the image has an error “abstraction” rushed “blured” “pixelaied” “low res”, and unsatisfactory. 

“It mocks the promises of digital technology” (Steyerl)

In film and art, every frame on screen is scene in purpose, so if something is hard to see abstracted in view, it was done with intention for the story’s meaning or character feeling. A poor image could evoke a similar reaction without intention from the creator as a result of digital computing errors resulting from loading, downloading, and or processing flaws. 


“Poor images are poor because they are not assigned any value within the class society of images”

(Steyerl)


Where a poor image can and can't be of value falls in the variables of Time and reachability, Access, Care of perfection, Image economy, and readiness

and intended use.

Someone today can snapshot or screen shot of anything on a status of capturing a feeling 

Or sense of paranoia, it now shows or possibility for intensity, fun,  distraction or humor with tooling and changing the image around to be poor. 

Image manipulation

From damage to transfers and reformats, a digital pixel shape can be smeared and blurred for visual wipe as well as assist in meaning wiped and blurred. 

We all experience a poor image and how to value with the use of digital cameras and computers. Almost everyone has had a choice decision on deleting and reshooting an image if it came out poor to our standards. Spending time to manipulate the image to adjust and edit out the bad quality to look more high-quality in lighting, shutter capture, and cropping, and not be a poor image. Sometimes, even shrinking or screen shot a photo of a photo to help quality on a poor image with low resolution. Last resort, having to replace an image, cutting it out, and having that it be empty or not seen over showing a poor image, and be seen as a producer of poor images, and poor work. That would be a downgrade feeling to me and my project of work. 

Though I also can see a value in a poor image when a natural glitch effect forms its own processing accord, and it displays an almost artistic interest and wanting to save what this random projection processing has appeared as 


“The poor image is no longer about the real thing” the original intention is altered and now displays new “conditions of existence” (Steyerl).

Remixed and repurposed quality re-seen with meaning and intended use as with memes today.

     A lasting effect I have with Walter Benjamin's The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction was when a classmate of mine drew on a photo of Walter Benjamin to make it look like he had tattoos on his face like a sound cloud rapper, and by classmate saying Walter would of proved of this as I am reproducing his photo with new modern meaning. Ever continuing the update of technological advancement and what it can do to create new meaning with art and media in reproduction uses. 
The opportunity to reproduce media with a connection to the original to then new meaning creates an opportunity to voice opinions and gather attention from the prior media's recognition to viewers. Copying has been done throughout history, from etching and engraving in woodcut to today, in a command prompt, to copy an art style and generate a new digital rendering. 
Benjamin understood the potential in reproduction in its early media form, seeing that “the eye perceives more than the hand can draw,” so visual media can get across better and faster. Getting strongly in a message as political propaganda has throughout history, and it note by Benjamin as “reproduced pieces of work can cause the most profound change and their impact on the public” and very much as an image staying in our mind when we think of a topic when we have seen that image multiple times.  
There are some limits, as Benjamin states about Aura, that reproduction work “lacks the original’s presence of time in space it was created in” being of the original art but not the complete same in significance as the artwork. A picture of the Mona Lisa is not the same as the painting of the Mona Lisa. Benjamin emphasizes the importance of “presence” to the original artwork as the “prerequisite of authenticity. Without aura, the reproduction is a half full purpose to represent the art, not art outside its reflections as one. Reproduction helps art be seen and is easier to show a reprinted photo of a statue than actually having to move the statue around the world, a different interaction than the real work, but the meaning of it can be seen and shared. 
New methods of technical reproduction of a work of art, can transform its nature as the age of mechanical reproduction separates art from its basis in cult, as the semblance disappears with a new reaction by viewers.

“Today the cult value would seem to demand that the work of art remain hidden. Certain statues of gods are accessible only to the priest in the cella; certain Madonnas remain covered nearly all year round; certain sculptures on medieval cathedrals are invisible to the spectator on ground level.”

Consumption of media meets a need to entertain by reproducing to get the message or story in a film that holds weight to ideas and propaganda as a tool to use and get out to people in an effective media use. Technique use is almost a sport of witness to its objectives, a Social significance, and as an art form.. Like an actor on screen, captured to be facing the public as their personality is spelled to the viewer. A film performing well to a viewer, Benjamin believes, is a state of distraction, when a film with its shock effect meets this mode of reception halfway, as the public is an examiner of the story and life captured and copied to be seen. 

“I can no longer think what I want to think. My thoughts have been replaced by moving images" The spectator's process of association in view of these images is indeed interrupted by their constant, sudden change. constitutes the shock effect of the film, which, like all shocks, should be cushioned by heightened presence of mind.” (Benjamin)
 Benjamin views with governing control in mass moment is fully in effect with war as it mobilizes all to technical resources while maintaining the property system.  Benjamin points out fascism in mass movement and media. I see this connection from art being owned privately by kings and churches, which made art inaccessible to the poor class. In what I believe Benjamin relates to that the former control was that of a dictatorial power of suppressing the art form in a controlled society. The status of art then changed with mass production and reproduction of art by duplication reprinting art to be able to be seen outside its original piece and available to the public.

      As We May Think (scan); As We May Think (W3C)by Vannevar Bush, 1945

A Scientific pause for a demand in common cause to advance people with computing technology.

In an era, scientists and engineers working in their peacetime laboratories to war-time destructive devices work, inspiration was no longer for innovation, it was changed to creation for destruction and stopping people, a moral imbalance to a view in ones work. Medical technology was a projection to think of having equitable tools that can perform efficiently and powerfully, and move more reliably than a human was an ideal future medical science of Bush's writing. In 1945, the medical advancement was using antibiotics; futurists saw Medical technology projected to have efficiency, an equitable supply of effective tools, and moving reliably more so than a human at a rate of a thousand times faster. We certainly have moved faster into today's use of more computer and tool-based medicine and surgical operations. The vision for tech to be available and reliable to the general public met Vannevar Bush's expectation, like the expression “A spider Web of metal, sealed in a thin glass container, a wire heated to a brilliant glow,” an advancement in tech but compact in our hands and daily use. Tech users live in the age of Bush's expectation of inexpensive smart devices that connect and entertain us with great reliability.

The Cyclops Camera forecasting of the GoPro camera use of a wide-angle compact small camera that can be mounted on a strap for a human head or attached to a bag or helmet with full HD capturing ability. The super secretary and the author need not write both foreseeing a robotic request for information assistant in ways that would become Siri with the iPhone talk Assistants, but in no way the intention scope in Bush envisioned.  

“Man has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his records more fully.”

Envisioning the future with tech is thinking of ways to improve and help humans in their challenges and requests, regardless of the modern advancement, the device's objective interacts with an input request for interpreting the result into action to solve such requests.

Bush states man cannot duplicate a mental process separating us from the machines, but in current times we are seeing the fact rivaled with AI chasing to be of life-like ability in answers and task ability rising and developing daily.  From 1945 task forecasting innovation with the Memex to today, seeing those ideas flourish with the personal computer and refined to the smartphone, to information and technology of tomorrow being scaled and reenvisioned to open possibilities, maybe even inside our mind, fused with the technology of tomorrow.

Theory: Chapters 1 & 2 The Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debord, 1967
<br/>
<br/>
When I think of Spectacle, I think of terms of media to stop people in their view and cast wonder upon them to think and be in the world of its art and media. Guy Debord talks about Spectacles in the foundation and systems of balance, cause and effect to society. In what felt like a poetic exploration to connections and breakdowns. The statement that spectacle is not a collection of images but a social relation among people crossed with by images that voice the power and hold it can have on people. It can be a presence of justification, a social economic formation, a historical engagement that will contain its audience. Holding truth and a reference to guide information and create lore form. It presents the past, but it's not real with us, but projected to be an enormous effect on life, but unaccessible.
Debord in one section says The spectacle is the nightmare of the imprisoned of modern society, which ultimately expresses nothing more than its desire to sleep. This makes me think of seeing an icon in society made up or someone built up as a heroic human, celebrated in status, sometimes even as a statue for good and right shaping lore of what a human can do puts other individuals to the test of that measure to live up to.The spectacle is the guardian of sleep that, after wondered in life, sleep is still dedicated to what was experienced and on the mind of a person and their life lived. Debord also states it is a diplomatic representation of hierarchical society in front of itself, where all other expression is banished. It can be this and a lack of cohesion in contradiction with itself, showing a human flaw, ability and selfish reasoning to be governing without concreteness.
If spectacle is nothing more than the common language of its own separation that connects it. Then what powers it is imaginative ideas to convince and create wonder with creativity and arc in the excitement to do in life. From the Capital that makes society function, and the world taking up all that exists in human activity in a fluid state
of accumulation that it becomes an image to our eyes of what is a possibility. As the world at once is present and absent in human flow of connection and limits, as “the spectacle makes the world of the commodity dominating all that is alive” visible to our senses and actions.

Theory: Constituents of a theory of the media by Enzensberger, 1970
Hans Magnus Enzensberger is very dense with his caution for the media in his writing Constituents of a theory of the media. Enzensberger has a high view of media for its potential in terms of value and power. A correlating force that whom has that power has an influence to the subjected viewers. Media in mobilization brands to use in political factors by electronic media and the use of propaganda. The power and use is one side as Enzensberger views television not as serving communication but prevents it for no reciprocal action between the transmitter is allowed with viewers. Radio, in his view would be a perfect form os public use media communication, transmitting and receiving. At the time of this work in the 1970s, radio was the efficient output media form to get a message out quickly and raw to radio stations. It's set up and purchased by the bourgeois for the media system, meaning not for public use. I wonder what Enzensberger thought of Pirate radio broadcasts.

The message and control of media comes down to the beholder the bigger the entirety, the more censorship in their hands of their media messaging control. A danger to that control is conflicts in the media field, at the time Enzensberger mentions trade unionism or liberalism affecting what are the ranges of media output. Media holders would aim to neutralize them and their voice for change. A socialist media theory has to work quickly and more extensively as a production. Walter Benjamin saw fit that it be done by rapidly increasing discrepancies and potential destructive forces. It can be dangerous as  Enzensberger writes that the beholders of the media underestimate growing conflicts in the media field and who it relates to. In comparison, Soviet society has to pay an immense price for the suppression of its own productive resources, bad procedures, misinformation, and “faux frais”. Censorship affects the freedom of ideas and the spreading of ideas, preventing freedom of the press.

“an argument within the bourgeoisie itself; for the masses, freedom to express opinions was a fiction since they were, from the beginning, barred from the means of production” (Enzensberger)

False options by media image leverage to gain trust over reality is described with the example of a office equipment firm using a photo of Che Guevara and text saying We would have hired him to tempt potential hires that this firm is in the ideals of Che Guevara and those in likeness of him should work here as Enzensberger put it “fear of handling shit is a luxury a sewer-man cannot necessarily afford”.

At the time of media control by the most advanced technogy was lacking in public ability to properly strategically use. This is echoed by the example of rebels seizing a territory location; they picked the Odéon Theatre over the radio station, exemplifying that radio wasn't strategically easy to use. Socialist movements use newspapers and journals, favoring the option of language, content, and form to play with in their media delivery for their messages to the public.  
Enzensberger describes that videotape and electronic cameras are victims of commercialism with no political viewpoint of their own.  The idea that media in the future would offer anyone the opportunity to become a producer, we accomplished that, but not in Enzensberger's hopes of remaining apolitical and limited to productive effort. His approach towards media is with an egalitarian view to level the playing field in action opportunity, but does everyone have the responsibility and skill commitment to do so?
Believing the opportunity of new media to due away with all educational privileges and thereby with the cultural monopoly of the bourgeois intelligentsia, today the art form flourishes into digital and tech creation and endless digital information shared and available, so systems weren't abolished, but alternative learning free and available has made a strong impact to people connected to new media.

Behind media ad sales is a mass consumption plan dedicated to needs that viewers are told to want to fulfill. Where truth is there or falsification and exploitation of legitimate needs, the process of the advertising machine rolls it out. The promises of the media and the mass need for non-material variety and mobility, Enzensberger saw this comparable in the material realization of private car-ownership and the hold of higher archy in status and life add its it has on people.  The political question to the mediaproprer does their use of media requires an organizational form of self-organization of the social needs they message to provide. 
In a message of hope for all working with the system and the people, a vision of a revolutionary plan can be a flowing system without needing the manipulators to disappear; through an equal part media system does make everyone a manipulator. 


Throughout the article, Enzensberger's words caution the use of media, as it is always in the form of some manipulation by media effect and tool to engage a reader to acknowledge media stipulations regarding what truth is, by who is to gain from it

Donna Haraway’s A Cyborg Manifesto makes the viewer think about their place within and amongst society. Referencing an integrated Circuit, a Common Language for Women in our society that is symbolized and related as to a cyborg being like the rest but different, split into views and consideration to life. Pointing questions to what aspects humans are faithful to feminism, socialism, and materialism. Reacting and writing to the treatment of women and feminist ideals as tech and cyborg identity with statements like 
“intimacy and with a power that was not generated in the history of sexuality” and “Cyborg replication is uncoupled from organic reproduction”. 
Haraway’s ideals of a cyborg gives life a purpose, an existence of ontology; it gives politics and a condensed image of both imagination and material reality.

The viewpoint also holds that a cyborg goes against  ‘Western’ science and politics,”—turning a path outside of racist, male-dominant capitalism; and self-progress. Differences could arise with conflicting viewpoints in humans vs cyborgs as organisms and machines could be a border war. 
Identity in social groups and lifestyles is what seems to be the call for important recognition of risk to livelihood. Haraway has great word association and making the viewer see connections. She is blending with examples as “attempting to heal the terrible cleavages of gender in an oral symbiotic utopia or post-oedipal apocalypse,” using a common body descriptive world in use for surface issues that strike today with gender, but could be healed tomorrow.
The cyborg is a creature in a post-gender world;  the fabrication of a heterosexual mate, 

Not really fully a human and not really a mechanical robot, a “ghost in the machine,”  a relation between materialism and idealism described in purpose as spirit or history, according to following with autonomous life. The lives of women throughout time have been given less opportunity from “gender formation” and “domination of woman/nature”. It seems Haraway sees an opportunity to take steps forward from that with the idea of a Cyborg as a technological move forward for a revolution of social relations. Who cyborgs will be is a radical question; the answers are a matter of survival. Cyborgs having life reasoning to decide for their own and a mechanical body outside of human limitations opens who a cyborg is and will by a radical question; by a matter of survival affecting their choices. 

Being Different is a cyborg 
They are the eyes of man, and reaction by hacking and rewriting identity.

Theory: Chapters 1 & 2 from The Electronic Disturbance by CAE, 1994

  <br/>
    <br/>

The electronic disturbance by Critical Art Ensemble CAE Artists working together as a group for 25 years. Formed in 1987 in Tallahassee, Florida, with a focus on the exploration of the intersections between art, critical theory,
technology, and political activism. Members: Steve Kurtz, Steve Barnes, Dorian Burr, Beverly Schlee, and Hope Kurtz. Their group artwork in biotech, tactical media installations, printed material, and videos resists authoritarian aspects of culture and injustice in capitalism, as well as to disrupt and interfere with the flow of it. 

The Electronic Disturbance (1994), talks about a revolution of Tech, a time of access to users being able to receive and send information in 1994. Early server access to the internet with AOL for consumers. The CAE presented it as a virtual geography, where a user can access political and cultural resistance by one asserting themselves in the electronic space.

The first chapter displays nice symbolic passages with two different versions on the top and bottom of the page as a before and after options as an advancement to best connect with audiences, by word choice, font, and size, with the flowery poetic language often used to describe in media theory writing.

As with the vision description referenced in chapter 1, of a plane, of the sun and all of the stars with earth and sea, and all living things as if exhibited upon a transparent globe. As if saying A future prediction of abilities with the internet of live streaming and video calls, and possibly Google Earth, seeing anywhere.

The reading motivates pro reasons to structure and organize, but also inspires the reader that disrupting power does not need to be complex to produce disturbances. The uses of technology give that access but also distraction as speed and absence into the digital space, and todo effective work also requires staying still and present on a computer and desk set up as CAE sees it, a Collide in hyperreality. The internet’s access to use as a tool must hold the user in time and place relating to CAE’s non location with repetitive action on the computer it prevents those caught in lock-down and tape loop with their actions to be heard but not seeing or feeling psychical effect tor change so they repeat in the digital space lie today with posting on forums and online social media in a cycle of their interest as a keyboard town cryers.

Information holds power, as “the nomad is free to wander the electronic net”, they are able to “cross national boundaries with minimal resistance from national control”, seeing the internet as an equality opportunity and optimism for the future. Citizens aren’t equal to the output power of companies and the government, but the ability to express an opinion at a valuable broadcast range of connected followers is now a current available tool, and be your suaveness, you could access a large audience and swaying control of influence in opinion by range of accessible by talent and skill at social media.  


"If we have nothing, at least we have the internet", living in a pod, but a live in VR.


Will the future hold restrictions in living cost and property governement or corporate-owned reusing us to rented out small living, and restrictions dictation by social credit by your internet activity, and how it could restrict living and options to people. There is a benefit to making people work for a standard status set by power entities, not wanting them to get out and control their own life options. A good media hook can convince anyone on a message. An effective image campaign can make people believe in an idea as a siding view for good or create fear from it.

Counting a negative measure takes response action following a free liberty to comment and speak voice to as “freedom is enhanced for those participating in the project.” Its strength is apparent and seen by those who take part and make use of it. With respect to CAE, mentioning that any action in response is a gamble of effectiveness and could face consequences. 

Though it shouldn’t make you quit, as Steve Barnes said in a talk “The Worst kind of censorship is self-censorship, stopping yourself before you even try thinking it's impossible”.

      Hamlet on the Holodeck: The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace by Janet Murray
    <br/>
       Evolution of motion imagery
Created visual engagement of photoplays striking human emotion by creating suspense by cutting between two actions into visual means by mood relation reaction by the series in the timeline establishes. Storytelling is spectacle presentation crafted by light processing darkness range, centering subject by focus and close-ups, scene building, montage, and emotional relation by timing in the assembly and properties of film. We engage film to give us something by entertainment and feeling by seeing and understanding people perform life in struggle and excitement at presentation level. Projecting and hold on an audience is a persuasive power. Janet Murray discuss films capturing tool in  “Hamlet on the Holodeck” and how 100 years later that tool is in our hands with the internet and digital technology. Electronic narrative and possibilities has advanced in ability far from  in what Murray was marveling digital technology doing in 1997 compared to media projections she was comparing of past projection of media in classic novels. The engagement has evolved but Murray points out the formulations that defined a film by theater show principles applied to photo play characteristics still guide media today, The aspects of the past stage performances are development stages that are formats from earlier technologies. Presentation view in analog timeline was taken and heighten to new visions being able to rearrange in possibilities with digital manipulation  computing space to view multiple images and moving video freely from order and choice of design. New Technology doesn’t always create impressive story, Murry references a Web show being exciting because it is online with buttons to active a script to see the acted dialog but in the quality is vivid in comparison of the rich feeling of live theater, an almost uncanny valley. Murry talks about “our clicking would then be motivated not by curiosity about the media objects and coming in any time in the story and review important past events as if pausing to google search a detail in the show that grabbed an attention. Interaction of computers can fool us into speaking as live like qualities but what misses is the nuance of understanding someone and not needing them to spell out clarity and issue of awareness limits with computer life like interlace with the Eliza and Teletype programs. Created to be so much like an actual person that we would no longer be able to tell when we were talking to a computer and when to a human being, effecting to is power seen todo with people confine in chatgpt but now knowing its not
Really but infectious to its response like its a human. Weizenbaum a creator of machines was concerted and wrote a book warning of the dangers of attributing human thought to machines. Text has a simpler path to copying a human  but to convince and mistake film images for the real world is more workin manipulation  but easily just as effective. Properties the enforce this environment is 
procedural in operation to be interactive and  want users to explore with it and make the experience extensive. Starting the medium to function with algorithms and heuristics by use of keywords to strike response and commands. Taking response answers and reverting them filling X variable with the answer in response creating a coherent dramatic dialogue.
Working because the program like computers is set up to be procedural and participatory. Creating program system results by coded if statements and processes that were more “conversational structure between the programmer and the program”. In the example of a game having to repeat mistakes and forcing the player to find the right way it is in Murrays interesting point that In a way, the computer was programming the player.

A key to compelling storytelling in a participatory medium lies in scripting the viewer to interact, and challenge by invent scripts formulaic enough to be easily grasped and responded to.The digital creation opens room for showing space and scale where print could only describe it. By power of the computers graphics and ram capability a display of maps, pictures, and three-dimensional models can be projected. Verify virtual space to another by action of retracing digital  steps. In digital projections like a game places have objective reality can to use and move throw feeling real and interaction has a much more concrete feeling on the screen “displaying a story that is also a place”.

Mouse-clicking through the mind of the insomniac is like a walk through a labyrinth. a maze mimics the physical tossing and turning
dead-end thinking of a person unable to fall asleep. 

A story navigation of virtual space but shaped shaped into a dramatic enactment of the plot for player control. The interaction is only as good as the installed knowledge “a huge capacity of electronic media is the encyclopedic expectation in a digital program to interact by. Thus to represent the world with both scope and particularity by window of a digital space. Allowing fandom to flourish and share in information published online to access.   

“The computer has developed during this time into a versatile tool for modeling systems that reflect our ideas about how the world is organized.” For more coverage and power in manipulation to tell stories that give us greater freedom and understanding to the world.

Lo and Behold: Reveries of the Connected World
Werner herzog
<br/>
From the invention to humanity forever changing Lo and Behold: Reveries of the Connected World by Werner Herzog explores to show how the internet started from its start to impacting us today and our future of information and connection. Can't tell the history of computers without its development originally from the military as war technology. The internet is referenced as one human to another, to the significance of settlers first spotting land. Other theorists see the internet's ability to share and change as like water as a changing system of relationships to visualize and encourage ideas to express interconnection. A concern is the loss is the connection to original sources like handwriting or printed books. Ted Nelson would want to see those connections there and not forgotten with an impact as a new brush to the past.
The internet helps people advance more than socially, as with open-access crowd-sourced research that video game developer Adrian Tory’s designed with scientific research using a supercomputer to help propel Molecular data. His program open to use on the web, generated results in huge numbers the success is a pro to the internet and skill sharing and collaborating to proliferate education and advancement with a connection to understand and build forward. I wonder today how that data from crowd-share use world compares to an AI program. Companies are using more advancement with computer technology and AI car companies are taking it forward, developing information that takes driving data by capturing real driving interactions with lidar to get data information of surrounding area to help give data points for autonomous self-driving cars. The company’s hope to project a system to have process of once one a car makes a mistake the next car and all others will never make that same mistake again with AI.
With advancement there is side effects, many people feel with the rise of wifi and technology radio waves that their Health declined and choose to stay away from wifi and radio signals for better health. Similar to the plot of the film Safe, the individuals live off the grid as a Luddite to no technology use in an area that does not get wifi or radio signals. The internet is powerful in its connections, but also an attraction with people having obsessions with it, needing internet rehab.
People and society are ever more relieving on the internet for our daily lives' foundational systems, from electricity power to the operations that make and deliver process our food. A theorist in the film claims that A solar flare could hit Earth and society would be 4 square meals away from falling apart in ruin. Worst of all, Not if but when?
With such risk, and yet society hasn’t turned away to be less reliant but increased it as a theorist on hacking and internet identity says he lines of life not and online Will be blurred our lives and separating people from their digital life will be impossible by how it will all interlink for important use. Can't have a bank account or sign in to an email without a phone for 2 part authentication. Authentication will forever be the challenge when in the world of the internet, where hacking and scamming is a job, and the biggest vulnerability to a hack is people as the weakest link. Some want the future to have technology to get away from the society and world humans created. Leaving Earth to inhabit an alien planet by tech advancement doesn’t solve our issue of not taking care of a planet as one interviewer mentioned,d living on a lifeboat isn’t a solutio,n as Even lifeboats need somewhere to land.

“Anyone who claims they know what’s gonna happen with the internet is not worth listening too”

We are far from robots assimilating to human life and understanding what it is to live in consciousness with humans, as the interaction is still human program input to command a robot. It is a pro-robot arena human-like like as Robots can be used as a physical tool to use and go where no human can in dangerous or emergency situations. Machines can learn to be faster
But cant learn to care and not harm. Ai doesn’t reveal itself to use, and its
been in our online operation systems and phone interactions for a long time now. What technology will add to our lives in the next phase of advancement and intelligence is a question of morals and what it means to be human when work will be for robots.

“What can we expect from one another and do when robots will do for us the undesired part of work and life”. “Knowing not a world without it”

The people in the future will create a system of importance with the use of information different from the association of today, since all information will be available and not a chosen skill of dedication to learn. Will that change affect the system of companionship with fellow humans, or will technology advance to replace and change that human dynamic as well?

* Theory: Introduction & Randomness10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10, by Nick Montfort et al, 2013
      <br/>
          <br/>
     Tech and how we use it has advanced from its release to the public, but rarely do we think about tech in large technical terms, tech has stayed the same. For advancement and access to opportunities in the sciences, arts, and engineering with tech, an understanding of the software is required for that building progression. The best way is to start with getting to know the background and informative history to gear the language and descriptions, and then take part in the development of the techno culture. Build and witness a user create 

A good balance of creation needs a bit of randomness to be something new and unlike before, a new, unexpected element is needed.

10 Prints by Nick Montfort chapter on randomness explores the role of randomness in computing and beyond in games, literature, the arts, and realms of culture. Since randomness is coded an occurrence with hap, the root of happy, Montfort says randomness might be a root meaning in connected etymology. Before science and mathematics predicted randomness was seen as a nightmare in less informed times. Practice acts of kindness, fears of random acts of violence have molded the association with the world to be scaled action and extreme depending on the relation and the surroundings. Random encounter is something we all can relate to in life, taking a step in the world or an unfamiliar area, a lot more to the experience of a random encounter, not the same as one in Dungeons and Dragons, but a random one at that. Science has only recently found an appropriate association and use of the word randomness when science aspires for an absolute meaning and answers. Words in computing have different uses meaning Print in computing is a command word to press to see a random figure move across the screen, an echo of the printing press still connected to modern technology in a different way, more honored and remembered. Randomness is in our lives from kids to adults, calculating or not thinking before taking a chance, and we deal with choosing with chance is a daily experience and modern intake as we try to tame it with data, learning, and optics. Interact with games of chance in human games we play in competitive thrill upon skill, mimicking, and disruption of control with rules and class setting by way of unpredictable outcomes will “fade smile upon the player” (Montfort)

To a gambler, it is “too diverse to become boring 

An interplay between pleasure and pain with a valued compression of time. Walter Benjamin is mentioned in the writing that the greater the aspect of chance in a game, the faster it elapses.

Randomness in social settings by formal indeterminacy allotment statistical methods, social indeterminacy, the importance of knowing someone's point of view to call or make a bluff, performative indeterminacy, the unreliability of one's own or another's actions, and fourth, Malaby's skepticism about fairness and legitimacy and rules. How one thinks can also reveal about them selfs in layers of randomness.

    <br/>

"God does not play dice with the universe."

    <br/>
Randomness found in a computer's programming echoes Malaby's idea of cosmological indeterminacy. Randomness operations are necessary to daily life for live to move it itself is framed as fixed, repeatable, and knowable to predict randomness. Unseen and shocking like art's wild sculpting or relating is the randomness is its significance, and the push to see it.  Today I think about randomness with algorithms on social media as it will find patterns amongst random data to search and played media to organize its own media playlist to present and hold your attention in an endless feed of random but connected allowing the viewer to media. From screensavers, password generators, to Ms. Pac-Man, randomness is covered in a lot of digital spaces.

  Race After Technology  by Ruha Benjamin
   <br/>
  <P>
     Tech to orderly involve us strategically follows a plan and hierarchy mainly for profit over equality and rightful morals. Ruha Benjamin makes points of tech's impact on race. Profitability over better restrictions for stronger human practices.  Tech connects and makes things easy to check in and see something, and feel like you know enough to make an opinion, a comment and an ease to make a donation and feel like you've done something. The eave of GoFundMe me fundraisers over the years that would capture people because they can feel like they helped without being physically involved, just digital with an online payment, but a feeling of satisfaction of doing something is given.  On a user level, this happens, and in a different level of profit from broadcasting human problems on TV with commercial ad revenue going to the network owners, a “profit to political power and symbolized resources”. Companies feel a need where tis a product or story for fear.  Image enrages emotions. Seeing a human character experience pain empathy induces a feeling when identifying with that character in a reflective image of self, and that intensifies the connection and action effect. Especially if an emotionally reactive person sees themselves in a person in the media, they then could view it as harm to that person is like harm to themselves. Tech works to that feeling in a McDonaldization effect of application easy to use and to your knowledge comfoibiity to get the feedback for your needs and solve your problem with a subscription that seems like a brand new gift of information in tech, but it's more a reinventing of the wheel of information out there just repackaged and structured for you in a limited designed menu. 
Social media can build Heavy criticism on human treatment, but by just digital action and a genuineness going passed a screen is questioned how much it matters to a person or company versus their statement versus the prohit and loyalty to favor a side of eliteness or trend. The ease, as Benjamin says, with “abolition’ promise to a problem can't be made by the system's action and profit so strongly in place. 
Benjamin says “empathy is woven more and more into the marketing of tech products,” but I'm not sure I think their marketing might want us to think that. Virtual reality has possibilities to give empathy to its users, opening a viewpoint, but where thats there to sell headsets to education, there's not always a guarantee how someone will understand the information or how they will engage with it forward, positive or negative. Vr leaning experience of a live stream police killing and how such a tragic, violent event can alter a person seeing and experiencing it in a reality view, bring to mind Jordan Wolfson’s VR Art, ‘Real Violence and how unexpected visitors were to experiencing it and trying VR and got a terrifying, violent uncomfortable feeling walking away from it with not much context. Somethings try to be good like the VR live feed of the 2017 hurricane in Puerto Rico, that Mark Zuckerberg used to try to show it was over there, but by being a product company actions for good are gonna be asked on whats gneuien or a commercial when a logo and avatar are advertised with good of showing a view of a hurrican and people experiencing it. As well as poverty misinformation for entertainment in a skew of criticism of reasons to live, view horrific events. Benjamin mentions "human-centered design balancing human first over profit.  

A role of product and design that “influences the distribution of risks, harms, and benefits among various groups of people ”Suggesting potential benefits of expression of a value system, by how we create space, solving a problem, visually shaping something, or by tool for maintaining power
Intentional” and helpful in building a foundation for solidarity. Permit dialog and connection between ideas that matter by innovative practices of design.
 
“An app will not save us”.
Yik Yak reminded Benjamin that people are not going to simply "age out" of White supremacy and racism. It's interesting that people feel to change racism, you need to change people, but I think most people are racist because they fear change and don't want to lose identity over what they dont know or control. 

Benjamin's student is right, it is an “all of us problem”, though some dont and will not ever come together. Their honesty is what can help build structure to coexist together, whether liked or not. The goal, I think, is respect as a human. With all the writing here is. question whether tech has the same goal. 

A future needs investment for social progression that doesn't just follow "Big Data processing to codify the past” and not move a different future. Pushing prioritizing equity for social good over profit efficiency is understandable want, but investors wouldn’t go for changing it. Investors' main point of business is to gain more and sell more, any chance of equality change would need to be done by the government in new regulations. Similar to regulations on companies having to limit their production pollution or adding green watering drainage space to all new construction. In other areas in tech of Ai training, AI Benjamin is like "like a child," to make us aware of social biases. I think its the reverse happening with children already growing up with it. The impact of the child and AI to learn the child from an early age from all the start of their data relationship. Pledge calling on organizations to take a stand "on the abuse of facial recognition analysis technology” is an action in showing people care to not let this out of hand and infringe upon their rights and ​​"show value for human life, and dignity.” Data is valuable but more understanding of that value si the tech companies. Jack Dorsey saying he believes that individuals should own their data puts in question would people actually do it or know if they had the option. 
I sometimes think if companies had a paid version to not use their data to sell media marketing info and advertise to the user would people buy in or take the unpaid data version like it is now but feel more involved given the option? The EBT tracking by data use is surveillance, and once tapped int,o could be used for other factors against a user. As an effective person said in the writing, "You should pay attention to what happens to us. You're next."
People allow control and restriction to the poor and those on assistance and in prison because a lower-class image gets set that a viewpoint is seen as a loss of rights and class status, so society does outcries it as they are undergoveerning forces by their circumstances. Not seeing the inherent human conditions and experience that could lead to all being affected like that sa a social credit control to keep people onine by fear of control and ability affected by social credit being lowered. Data could affect everything in our lives in the future, where it could drive people away from cities and to the woods, where there's no financial recognition for capital cities.

          GLITCH FEMINISM A Manifesto by LEGACY RUSSELL 
         <br/>
     Glitches undetectable till they reveal themselves, 
     altering and lowering the quality and seamless illusion of life captured in a video or image. 
     The few times the human side of tech comes to view, showing the flaw possibility to digital rendering interruptions and numbers 
     computing not always outputting correctly. Most people don’t know how a computer works or why, but they know when they’ve experienced 
     a glitch in their digital operation expectations, interrupted and flawed results. Processing glitch and algorithm glitch c
     lash with the manual when trying to input and auto-fill data, tries to answer what it thinks best as opposed to a manual correct input, 
     these are areas where the data can be a wrong intention to the situation needed. Fresh learning for the data or more manual input could
     be the answer. banally m complicit with the individual taking and personal task of doing in our control in exchange for our own personal 
     data taken for auto operation. Digital platforms have an online identity from our online activity, with frequent best results to say
     the platform knows us better than we know ourselves, suggesting and choosing how we are to be portrayed and giving to marketing 
     and advertising. Want vs business priorities for sales. The use of computers became part of human activity and action. 
     The problem, error, and glitch with computers happened and named for the extended experience to describe random real 
     problems to happen. There's a power and satisfaction in being understood to experience and what you felt, and with digital interaction,
     Russel adds to this satisfaction as “where people assume if they can find a word to describe something, that this is the beginning of
     controlling it,” it being the error, the glitch to the problem. Digital programs are assigned action to given results from the start 
     by text responses written in with no area for full face value visual and audio, and previous interactions with others to base information 
     on someone. Russel zones jn the flaw of fitting someone into a box that the digital program gives based on its limited given options. 
     Some programs are flawed in not updating with the times, flawed in not thinking ahead, or in the biases of their creators. 
     I sometimes think the creators know the code, not the lives they dont live, and create an inability to identify someone. 
     The downside of one person trying to do it all, mathematical program design, and user human experience interface. 
     In a reverse control on this issue of assessment labeling, Russel talks about maybe what was and was not visible there would help me 
     circumnavigate and escape the "suffering that comes from the condition of being addressable," of being called, defined, 
     named in identity perception control. Humans have a choice in being themselves by creating a split from the original entity. 
     Digital programs don't have this opportunity or evolve into their action. Something that can greatly depict a person and their 
     digital identity can't evolve like a person can be programmed to represent. Russell advocates a feminist making theory to have a 
     service of healing and creation, rather than in the service of destruction." By Conversely, cárdenas's "stitch" using one entity 
     to connect two formerly separate entities," that is better for its "less violent than the cut" as it "intends to join,”
     I see Russell's words aligned to the feeling that our digital representation to user could benefit to A breaking and healing developing 
     function detailed by the digital as performative action to develop and evolve by the user. Russel's writing critiques digital organization
     and tech being mainly white and straight in perspective, this could be the eye of the beholder or profit focus to market, but the online space 
     goes beyond the market sale of the exchange, it's a human connection experience, people care how their identity is seen to be connected with.

Does Digital Culture Want to be Free?
How Blockchains are Transforming the Economy of Cultural Goods
Rachel O'Dwyer
<br/>
<br/>
Connecting to online space was so much about the digital devices; now it's all in one less every year, with a scarcity of physical technology artifact accessories. As more services are fitted and expected to one device, 
    the increase of digital files and speed expands and comes at risk of a hack or crash. 
    Prevention for reproduction of the digital files is counteracted with 'Digital rights management', regionally specific codecs, rootkits, embedded watermarks, security codes, and algorithmic copy protection.
Amazon is talked about as an example of companies enforcing their power with their produced products, as Amazon has done taking away books, deleting purchased books off from Kindle devices. This reminds me of Nintendo deleting games and online access to games that were
    purchased and digital downloads that people lose access to, due to Nintendo's controlling gameplay limits and options.
Money needs are to control supply and issuance. The internet can enhance that with access and cause more problems with hacker break-ins, copy and steal interruptions. 
    Bitcoin follows these needs as a digital currency following a measure and standard of tokens of intangible bits of information, with the risk of duplication of the same token being spent twice.
The guarding and safe balance of digital currency with the practice of the blockchain has made people care about the authenticity of cultural goods with the currency and products. As digital sales and subscriptions, and customer service leads the product and job market, a great deal of resources and development are being allocated to build up and be 
    stronger to function at the scale of public large population use. Programs built to scan and prevent hacking use to protect the money and copyright to products it represents and sells. An artist could use a blockchain to represent value to buy the art in digital currency and availability as an address and public identifier for the artwork, 
    with a passcode set that can be transferred in an exchange of sales from address to address, completing the sale by giving the new owner the passcode. Digital payment and trade have been integrated to consumers and small markers in a direction to expand in independent selling markets and art scenes, with sites like Venmo and PayPal used 
    for art exchange, as well as digital downloads of work shared and put up for customers to easily buy and take their own files to be downloaded. I once requested scans of an old skateboarding magazine to be scanned and sent to me by an archivist to be used in a video I worked on to feature the documentation, and it was all transferred 
    through online communication, digital money exchange, and file transfer sites for me to download and use. Where blockchains have been mainly seen as a Miami bro culture money get rich quick rug pull schemes or NFT art hype, where Rachel O’Dwyer in her writing tells of possible benefits to blockchain and companies like Ascribe, Monegraph 
    and Ujo offering use for artists with hopes in stronger property rights with ownership and sales clear and still upholding digital rights to creative commons use and in the challenge to regulate the internet of use, download and reproduction of digital artifacts. It comes down to money if the blockchain will be fully integrated as a top monetary 
    currency to the mainstream, as the monetization is there, it's more on people believing in this stronger property rights and legalities are no longer where the money is at, and believe artists and Digital culture seeks to be and can be free in the world of blockchains.
