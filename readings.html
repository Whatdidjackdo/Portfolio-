      Do digital users prioritize status in judging hierarchy in their use of image and digital interaction? Where does the approval land? Is it subconscious to critical thought yet registered and known on how to answer if questioned? 

Hito Steyerl points in the area that our connected communication integration by digital imagery ranges in the class of Rich imagery of standard and approval for use in following corrections nd expectation in contrast to the poor image being defective in perfection value to standard but not in creative use and artistic choice in meaning by visual style. Digital imagery is integrated by society's use in community interface of feed consumption of media. That consumption is supplied, uploaded and refreshed with new entries every second. From capital advertisement or user posting as self-offering in self-display, it can accelerate forward in use or denied by rules of image approval, or deteriorate value depending on the update evolution standards and phasing out the unapproved. 


The internet and social media would not be the same without images to amply subject and engagement online. So much of the interaction is with images “ripped, remixed, copied, pasted” and posted from selected and approved images for our meaning of image communication in online posting with digital images. Like beauty standards and self-image, we want our images to reflect good quality if it’s of ourselves or the communication in that image to be delivered correctly and clear. When it cant be clear, the image has an error “abstraction” rushed “blured” “pixelaied” “low res”, and unsatisfactory. 

“It mocks the promises of digital technology” (Steyerl)

In film and art, every frame on screen is scene in purpose, so if something is hard to see abstracted in view, it was done with intention for the story’s meaning or character feeling. A poor image could evoke a similar reaction without intention from the creator as a result of digital computing errors resulting from loading, downloading, and or processing flaws. 


“Poor images are poor because they are not assigned any value within the class society of images”

(Steyerl)


Where a poor image can and can't be of value falls in the variables of Time and reachability, Access, Care of perfection, Image economy, and readiness

and intended use.

Someone today can snapshot or screen shot of anything on a status of capturing a feeling 

Or sense of paranoia, it now shows or possibility for intensity, fun,  distraction or humor with tooling and changing the image around to be poor. 

Image manipulation

From damage to transfers and reformats, a digital pixel shape can be smeared and blurred for visual wipe as well as assist in meaning wiped and blurred. 

We all experience a poor image and how to value with the use of digital cameras and computers. Almost everyone has had a choice decision on deleting and reshooting an image if it came out poor to our standards. Spending time to manipulate the image to adjust and edit out the bad quality to look more high-quality in lighting, shutter capture, and cropping, and not be a poor image. Sometimes, even shrinking or screen shot a photo of a photo to help quality on a poor image with low resolution. Last resort, having to replace an image, cutting it out, and having that it be empty or not seen over showing a poor image, and be seen as a producer of poor images, and poor work. That would be a downgrade feeling to me and my project of work. 

Though I also can see a value in a poor image when a natural glitch effect forms its own processing accord, and it displays an almost artistic interest and wanting to save what this random projection processing has appeared as 


“The poor image is no longer about the real thing” the original intention is altered and now displays new “conditions of existence” (Steyerl).

Remixed and repurposed quality re-seen with meaning and intended use as with memes today.

     A lasting effect I have with Walter Benjamin's The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction was when a classmate of mine drew on a photo of Walter Benjamin to make it look like he had tattoos on his face like a sound cloud rapper, and by classmate saying Walter would of proved of this as I am reproducing his photo with new modern meaning. Ever continuing the update of technological advancement and what it can do to create new meaning with art and media in reproduction uses. 
The opportunity to reproduce media with a connection to the original to then new meaning creates an opportunity to voice opinions and gather attention from the prior media's recognition to viewers. Copying has been done throughout history, from etching and engraving in woodcut to today, in a command prompt, to copy an art style and generate a new digital rendering. 
Benjamin understood the potential in reproduction in its early media form, seeing that “the eye perceives more than the hand can draw,” so visual media can get across better and faster. Getting strongly in a message as political propaganda has throughout history, and it note by Benjamin as “reproduced pieces of work can cause the most profound change and their impact on the public” and very much as an image staying in our mind when we think of a topic when we have seen that image multiple times.  
There are some limits, as Benjamin states about Aura, that reproduction work “lacks the original’s presence of time in space it was created in” being of the original art but not the complete same in significance as the artwork. A picture of the Mona Lisa is not the same as the painting of the Mona Lisa. Benjamin emphasizes the importance of “presence” to the original artwork as the “prerequisite of authenticity. Without aura, the reproduction is a half full purpose to represent the art, not art outside its reflections as one. Reproduction helps art be seen and is easier to show a reprinted photo of a statue than actually having to move the statue around the world, a different interaction than the real work, but the meaning of it can be seen and shared. 
New methods of technical reproduction of a work of art, can transform its nature as the age of mechanical reproduction separates art from its basis in cult, as the semblance disappears with a new reaction by viewers.

“Today the cult value would seem to demand that the work of art remain hidden. Certain statues of gods are accessible only to the priest in the cella; certain Madonnas remain covered nearly all year round; certain sculptures on medieval cathedrals are invisible to the spectator on ground level.”

Consumption of media meets a need to entertain by reproducing to get the message or story in a film that holds weight to ideas and propaganda as a tool to use and get out to people in an effective media use. Technique use is almost a sport of witness to its objectives, a Social significance, and as an art form.. Like an actor on screen, captured to be facing the public as their personality is spelled to the viewer. A film performing well to a viewer, Benjamin believes, is a state of distraction, when a film with its shock effect meets this mode of reception halfway, as the public is an examiner of the story and life captured and copied to be seen. 

“I can no longer think what I want to think. My thoughts have been replaced by moving images" The spectator's process of association in view of these images is indeed interrupted by their constant, sudden change. constitutes the shock effect of the film, which, like all shocks, should be cushioned by heightened presence of mind.” (Benjamin)
 Benjamin views with governing control in mass moment is fully in effect with war as it mobilizes all to technical resources while maintaining the property system.  Benjamin points out fascism in mass movement and media. I see this connection from art being owned privately by kings and churches, which made art inaccessible to the poor class. In what I believe Benjamin relates to that the former control was that of a dictatorial power of suppressing the art form in a controlled society. The status of art then changed with mass production and reproduction of art by duplication reprinting art to be able to be seen outside its original piece and available to the public.

      As We May Think (scan); As We May Think (W3C)by Vannevar Bush, 1945

A Scientific pause for a demand in common cause to advance people with computing technology.

In an era, scientists and engineers working in their peacetime laboratories to war-time destructive devices work, inspiration was no longer for innovation, it was changed to creation for destruction and stopping people, a moral imbalance to a view in ones work. Medical technology was a projection to think of having equitable tools that can perform efficiently and powerfully, and move more reliably than a human was an ideal future medical science of Bush's writing. In 1945, the medical advancement was using antibiotics; futurists saw Medical technology projected to have efficiency, an equitable supply of effective tools, and moving reliably more so than a human at a rate of a thousand times faster. We certainly have moved faster into today's use of more computer and tool-based medicine and surgical operations. The vision for tech to be available and reliable to the general public met Vannevar Bush's expectation, like the expression “A spider Web of metal, sealed in a thin glass container, a wire heated to a brilliant glow,” an advancement in tech but compact in our hands and daily use. Tech users live in the age of Bush's expectation of inexpensive smart devices that connect and entertain us with great reliability.

The Cyclops Camera forecasting of the GoPro camera use of a wide-angle compact small camera that can be mounted on a strap for a human head or attached to a bag or helmet with full HD capturing ability. The super secretary and the author need not write both foreseeing a robotic request for information assistant in ways that would become Siri with the iPhone talk Assistants, but in no way the intention scope in Bush envisioned.  

“Man has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his records more fully.”

Envisioning the future with tech is thinking of ways to improve and help humans in their challenges and requests, regardless of the modern advancement, the device's objective interacts with an input request for interpreting the result into action to solve such requests.

Bush states man cannot duplicate a mental process separating us from the machines, but in current times we are seeing the fact rivaled with AI chasing to be of life-like ability in answers and task ability rising and developing daily.  From 1945 task forecasting innovation with the Memex to today, seeing those ideas flourish with the personal computer and refined to the smartphone, to information and technology of tomorrow being scaled and reenvisioned to open possibilities, maybe even inside our mind, fused with the technology of tomorrow.

          GLITCH FEMINISM A Manifesto by LEGACY RUSSELL 
         <br/>
     Glitches undetectable till they reveal themselves, 
     altering and lowering the quality and seamless illusion of life captured in a video or image. 
     The few times the human side of tech comes to view, showing the flaw possibility to digital rendering interruptions and numbers 
     computing not always outputting correctly. Most people don’t know how a computer works or why, but they know when they’ve experienced 
     a glitch in their digital operation expectations, interrupted and flawed results. Processing glitch and algorithm glitch c
     lash with the manual when trying to input and auto-fill data, tries to answer what it thinks best as opposed to a manual correct input, 
     these are areas where the data can be a wrong intention to the situation needed. Fresh learning for the data or more manual input could
     be the answer. banally m complicit with the individual taking and personal task of doing in our control in exchange for our own personal 
     data taken for auto operation. Digital platforms have an online identity from our online activity, with frequent best results to say
     the platform knows us better than we know ourselves, suggesting and choosing how we are to be portrayed and giving to marketing 
     and advertising. Want vs business priorities for sales. The use of computers became part of human activity and action. 
     The problem, error, and glitch with computers happened and named for the extended experience to describe random real 
     problems to happen. There's a power and satisfaction in being understood to experience and what you felt, and with digital interaction,
     Russel adds to this satisfaction as “where people assume if they can find a word to describe something, that this is the beginning of
     controlling it,” it being the error, the glitch to the problem. Digital programs are assigned action to given results from the start 
     by text responses written in with no area for full face value visual and audio, and previous interactions with others to base information 
     on someone. Russel zones jn the flaw of fitting someone into a box that the digital program gives based on its limited given options. 
     Some programs are flawed in not updating with the times, flawed in not thinking ahead, or in the biases of their creators. 
     I sometimes think the creators know the code, not the lives they dont live, and create an inability to identify someone. 
     The downside of one person trying to do it all, mathematical program design, and user human experience interface. 
     In a reverse control on this issue of assessment labeling, Russel talks about maybe what was and was not visible there would help me 
     circumnavigate and escape the "suffering that comes from the condition of being addressable," of being called, defined, 
     named in identity perception control. Humans have a choice in being themselves by creating a split from the original entity. 
     Digital programs don't have this opportunity or evolve into their action. Something that can greatly depict a person and their 
     digital identity can't evolve like a person can be programmed to represent. Russell advocates a feminist making theory to have a 
     service of healing and creation, rather than in the service of destruction." By Conversely, cárdenas's "stitch" using one entity 
     to connect two formerly separate entities," that is better for its "less violent than the cut" as it "intends to join,”
     I see Russell's words aligned to the feeling that our digital representation to user could benefit to A breaking and healing developing 
     function detailed by the digital as performative action to develop and evolve by the user. Russel's writing critiques digital organization
     and tech being mainly white and straight in perspective, this could be the eye of the beholder or profit focus to market, but the online space 
     goes beyond the market sale of the exchange, it's a human connection experience, people care how their identity is seen to be connected with.

Does Digital Culture Want to be Free?
How Blockchains are Transforming the Economy of Cultural Goods
Rachel O'Dwyer
<br/>
<br/>
Connecting to online space was so much about the digital devices; now it's all in one less every year, with a scarcity of physical technology artifact accessories. As more services are fitted and expected to one device, 
    the increase of digital files and speed expands and comes at risk of a hack or crash. 
    Prevention for reproduction of the digital files is counteracted with 'Digital rights management', regionally specific codecs, rootkits, embedded watermarks, security codes, and algorithmic copy protection.
Amazon is talked about as an example of companies enforcing their power with their produced products, as Amazon has done taking away books, deleting purchased books off from Kindle devices. This reminds me of Nintendo deleting games and online access to games that were
    purchased and digital downloads that people lose access to, due to Nintendo's controlling gameplay limits and options.
Money needs are to control supply and issuance. The internet can enhance that with access and cause more problems with hacker break-ins, copy and steal interruptions. 
    Bitcoin follows these needs as a digital currency following a measure and standard of tokens of intangible bits of information, with the risk of duplication of the same token being spent twice.
The guarding and safe balance of digital currency with the practice of the blockchain has made people care about the authenticity of cultural goods with the currency and products. As digital sales and subscriptions, and customer service leads the product and job market, a great deal of resources and development are being allocated to build up and be 
    stronger to function at the scale of public large population use. Programs built to scan and prevent hacking use to protect the money and copyright to products it represents and sells. An artist could use a blockchain to represent value to buy the art in digital currency and availability as an address and public identifier for the artwork, 
    with a passcode set that can be transferred in an exchange of sales from address to address, completing the sale by giving the new owner the passcode. Digital payment and trade have been integrated to consumers and small markers in a direction to expand in independent selling markets and art scenes, with sites like Venmo and PayPal used 
    for art exchange, as well as digital downloads of work shared and put up for customers to easily buy and take their own files to be downloaded. I once requested scans of an old skateboarding magazine to be scanned and sent to me by an archivist to be used in a video I worked on to feature the documentation, and it was all transferred 
    through online communication, digital money exchange, and file transfer sites for me to download and use. Where blockchains have been mainly seen as a Miami bro culture money get rich quick rug pull schemes or NFT art hype, where Rachel O’Dwyer in her writing tells of possible benefits to blockchain and companies like Ascribe, Monegraph 
    and Ujo offering use for artists with hopes in stronger property rights with ownership and sales clear and still upholding digital rights to creative commons use and in the challenge to regulate the internet of use, download and reproduction of digital artifacts. It comes down to money if the blockchain will be fully integrated as a top monetary 
    currency to the mainstream, as the monetization is there, it's more on people believing in this stronger property rights and legalities are no longer where the money is at, and believe artists and Digital culture seeks to be and can be free in the world of blockchains.
