      Do digital users prioritize status in judging hierarchy in their use of image and digital interaction? Where does the approval land? Is it subconscious to critical thought yet registered and known on how to answer if questioned? 

Hito Steyerl points in the area that our connected communication integration by digital imagery ranges in the class of Rich imagery of standard and approval for use in following corrections nd expectation in contrast to the poor image being defective in perfection value to standard but not in creative use and artistic choice in meaning by visual style. Digital imagery is integrated by society's use in community interface of feed consumption of media. That consumption is supplied, uploaded and refreshed with new entries every second. From capital advertisement or user posting as self-offering in self-display, it can accelerate forward in use or denied by rules of image approval, or deteriorate value depending on the update evolution standards and phasing out the unapproved. 


The internet and social media would not be the same without images to amply subject and engagement online. So much of the interaction is with images “ripped, remixed, copied, pasted” and posted from selected and approved images for our meaning of image communication in online posting with digital images. Like beauty standards and self-image, we want our images to reflect good quality if it’s of ourselves or the communication in that image to be delivered correctly and clear. When it cant be clear, the image has an error “abstraction” rushed “blured” “pixelaied” “low res”, and unsatisfactory. 

“It mocks the promises of digital technology” (Steyerl)

In film and art, every frame on screen is scene in purpose, so if something is hard to see abstracted in view, it was done with intention for the story’s meaning or character feeling. A poor image could evoke a similar reaction without intention from the creator as a result of digital computing errors resulting from loading, downloading, and or processing flaws. 


“Poor images are poor because they are not assigned any value within the class society of images”

(Steyerl)


Where a poor image can and can't be of value falls in the variables of Time and reachability, Access, Care of perfection, Image economy, and readiness

and intended use.

Someone today can snapshot or screen shot of anything on a status of capturing a feeling 

Or sense of paranoia, it now shows or possibility for intensity, fun,  distraction or humor with tooling and changing the image around to be poor. 

Image manipulation

From damage to transfers and reformats, a digital pixel shape can be smeared and blurred for visual wipe as well as assist in meaning wiped and blurred. 

We all experience a poor image and how to value with the use of digital cameras and computers. Almost everyone has had a choice decision on deleting and reshooting an image if it came out poor to our standards. Spending time to manipulate the image to adjust and edit out the bad quality to look more high-quality in lighting, shutter capture, and cropping, and not be a poor image. Sometimes, even shrinking or screen shot a photo of a photo to help quality on a poor image with low resolution. Last resort, having to replace an image, cutting it out, and having that it be empty or not seen over showing a poor image, and be seen as a producer of poor images, and poor work. That would be a downgrade feeling to me and my project of work. 

Though I also can see a value in a poor image when a natural glitch effect forms its own processing accord, and it displays an almost artistic interest and wanting to save what this random projection processing has appeared as 


“The poor image is no longer about the real thing” the original intention is altered and now displays new “conditions of existence” (Steyerl).

Remixed and repurposed quality re-seen with meaning and intended use as with memes today.

Does Digital Culture Want to be Free?
How Blockchains are Transforming the Economy of Cultural Goods
Rachel O'Dwyer
<br/>
Connecting to online space was so much about the digital devices; now it's all in one less every year, with a scarcity of physical technology artifact accessories. As more services are fitted and expected to one device, 
    the increase of digital files and speed expands and comes at risk of a hack or crash. 
    Prevention for reproduction of the digital files is counteracted with 'Digital rights management', regionally specific codecs, rootkits, embedded watermarks, security codes, and algorithmic copy protection.
Amazon is talked about as an example of companies enforcing their power with their produced products, as Amazon has done taking away books, deleting purchased books off from Kindle devices. This reminds me of Nintendo deleting games and online access to games that were
    purchased and digital downloads that people lose access to, due to Nintendo's controlling gameplay limits and options.
Money needs are to control supply and issuance. The internet can enhance that with access and cause more problems with hacker break-ins, copy and steal interruptions. 
    Bitcoin follows these needs as a digital currency following a measure and standard of tokens of intangible bits of information, with the risk of duplication of the same token being spent twice.
The guarding and safe balance of digital currency with the practice of the blockchain has made people care about the authenticity of cultural goods with the currency and products. As digital sales and subscriptions, and customer service leads the product and job market, a great deal of resources and development are being allocated to build up and be 
    stronger to function at the scale of public large population use. Programs built to scan and prevent hacking use to protect the money and copyright to products it represents and sells. An artist could use a blockchain to represent value to buy the art in digital currency and availability as an address and public identifier for the artwork, 
    with a passcode set that can be transferred in an exchange of sales from address to address, completing the sale by giving the new owner the passcode. Digital payment and trade have been integrated to consumers and small markers in a direction to expand in independent selling markets and art scenes, with sites like Venmo and PayPal used 
    for art exchange, as well as digital downloads of work shared and put up for customers to easily buy and take their own files to be downloaded. I once requested scans of an old skateboarding magazine to be scanned and sent to me by an archivist to be used in a video I worked on to feature the documentation, and it was all transferred 
    through online communication, digital money exchange, and file transfer sites for me to download and use. Where blockchains have been mainly seen as a Miami bro culture money get rich quick rug pull schemes or NFT art hype, where Rachel O’Dwyer in her writing tells of possible benefits to blockchain and companies like Ascribe, Monegraph 
    and Ujo offering use for artists with hopes in stronger property rights with ownership and sales clear and still upholding digital rights to creative commons use and in the challenge to regulate the internet of use, download and reproduction of digital artifacts. It comes down to money if the blockchain will be fully integrated as a top monetary 
    currency to the mainstream, as the monetization is there, it's more on people believing in this stronger property rights and legalities are no longer where the money is at, and believe artists and Digital culture seeks to be and can be free in the world of blockchains.
