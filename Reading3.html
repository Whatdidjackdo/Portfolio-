      As We May Think (scan); As We May Think (W3C)by Vannevar Bush, 1945



A Scientific pause for a demand in common cause to advance people with computing technology.

In an era, scientists and engineers working in their peacetime laboratories to war-time destructive devices work, inspiration was no longer for innovation, it was changed to creation for destruction and stopping people, a moral imbalance to a view in ones work. Medical technology was a projection to think of having equitable tools that can perform efficiently and powerfully, and move more reliably than a human was an ideal future medical science of Bush's writing. In 1945, the medical advancement was using antibiotics; futurists saw Medical technology projected to have efficiency, an equitable supply of effective tools, and moving reliably more so than a human at a rate of a thousand times faster. We certainly have moved faster into today's use of more computer and tool-based medicine and surgical operations. The vision for tech to be available and reliable to the general public met Vannevar Bush's expectation, like the expression “A spider Web of metal, sealed in a thin glass container, a wire heated to a brilliant glow,” an advancement in tech but compact in our hands and daily use. Tech users live in the age of Bush's expectation of inexpensive smart devices that connect and entertain us with great reliability.



The Cyclops Camera forecasting of the GoPro camera use of a wide-angle compact small camera that can be mounted on a strap for a human head or attached to a bag or helmet with full HD capturing ability. The super secretary and the author need not write both foreseeing a robotic request for information assistant in ways that would become Siri with the iPhone talk Assistants, but in no way the intention scope in Bush envisioned.  



“Man has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his records more fully.”



Envisioning the future with tech is thinking of ways to improve and help humans in their challenges and requests, regardless of the modern advancement, the device's objective interacts with an input request for interpreting the result into action to solve such requests.

Bush states man cannot duplicate a mental process separating us from the machines, but in current times we are seeing the fact rivaled with AI chasing to be of life-like ability in answers and task ability rising and developing daily.  From 1945 task forecasting innovation with the Memex to today, seeing those ideas flourish with the personal computer and refined to the smartphone, to information and technology of tomorrow being scaled and reenvisioned to open possibilities, maybe even inside our mind, fused with the technology of tomorrow.
