     Reading 11
     Tech to orderly involve us strategically follows a plan and hierarchy mainly for profit over equality and rightful morals. Ruha Benjamin makes points of tech's impact on race. Profitability over better restrictions for stronger human practices.  Tech connects and makes things easy to check in and see something, and feel like you know enough to make an opinion, a comment and an ease to make a donation and feel like you've done something. The eave of GoFundMe me fundraisers over the years that would capture people because they can feel like they helped without being physically involved, just digital with an online payment, but a feeling of satisfaction of doing something is given.  On a user level, this happens, and in a different level of profit from broadcasting human problems on TV with commercial ad revenue going to the network owners, a “profit to political power and symbolized resources”. Companies feel a need where tis a product or story for fear.  Image enrages emotions. Seeing a human character experience pain empathy induces a feeling when identifying with that character in a reflective image of self, and that intensifies the connection and action effect. Especially if an emotionally reactive person sees themselves in a person in the media, they then could view it as harm to that person is like harm to themselves. Tech works to that feeling in a McDonaldization effect of application easy to use and to your knowledge comfoibiity to get the feedback for your needs and solve your problem with a subscription that seems like a brand new gift of information in tech, but it's more a reinventing of the wheel of information out there just repackaged and structured for you in a limited designed menu. 
Social media can build Heavy criticism on human treatment, but by just digital action and a genuineness going passed a screen is questioned how much it matters to a person or company versus their statement versus the prohit and loyalty to favor a side of eliteness or trend. The ease, as Benjamin says, with “abolition’ promise to a problem can't be made by the system's action and profit so strongly in place. 
Benjamin says “empathy is woven more and more into the marketing of tech products,” but I'm not sure I think their marketing might want us to think that. Virtual reality has possibilities to give empathy to its users, opening a viewpoint, but where thats there to sell headsets to education, there's not always a guarantee how someone will understand the information or how they will engage with it forward, positive or negative. Vr leaning experience of a live stream police killing and how such a tragic, violent event can alter a person seeing and experiencing it in a reality view, bring to mind Jordan Wolfson’s VR Art, ‘Real Violence and how unexpected visitors were to experiencing it and trying VR and got a terrifying, violent uncomfortable feeling walking away from it with not much context. Somethings try to be good like the VR live feed of the 2017 hurricane in Puerto Rico, that Mark Zuckerberg used to try to show it was over there, but by being a product company actions for good are gonna be asked on whats gneuien or a commercial when a logo and avatar are advertised with good of showing a view of a hurrican and people experiencing it. As well as poverty misinformation for entertainment in a skew of criticism of reasons to live, view horrific events. Benjamin mentions "human-centered design balancing human first over profit.  

A role of product and design that “influences the distribution of risks, harms, and benefits among various groups of people ”Suggesting potential benefits of expression of a value system, by how we create space, solving a problem, visually shaping something, or by tool for maintaining power
Intentional” and helpful in building a foundation for solidarity. Permit dialog and connection between ideas that matter by innovative practices of design.
 
“An app will not save us”.
Yik Yak reminded Benjamin that people are not going to simply "age out" of White supremacy and racism. It's interesting that people feel to change racism, you need to change people, but I think most people are racist because they fear change and don't want to lose identity over what they dont know or control. 

Benjamin's student is right, it is an “all of us problem”, though some dont and will not ever come together. Their honesty is what can help build structure to coexist together, whether liked or not. The goal, I think, is respect as a human. With all the writing here is. question whether tech has the same goal. 

A future needs investment for social progression that doesn't just follow "Big Data processing to codify the past” and not move a different future. Pushing prioritizing equity for social good over profit efficiency is understandable want, but investors wouldn’t go for changing it. Investors' main point of business is to gain more and sell more, any chance of equality change would need to be done by the government in new regulations. Similar to regulations on companies having to limit their production pollution or adding green watering drainage space to all new construction. In other areas in tech of Ai training, AI Benjamin is like "like a child," to make us aware of social biases. I think its the reverse happening with children already growing up with it. The impact of the child and AI to learn the child from an early age from all the start of their data relationship. Pledge calling on organizations to take a stand "on the abuse of facial recognition analysis technology” is an action in showing people care to not let this out of hand and infringe upon their rights and ​​"show value for human life, and dignity.” Data is valuable but more understanding of that value si the tech companies. Jack Dorsey saying he believes that individuals should own their data puts in question would people actually do it or know if they had the option. 
I sometimes think if companies had a paid version to not use their data to sell media marketing info and advertise to the user would people buy in or take the unpaid data version like it is now but feel more involved given the option? The EBT tracking by data use is surveillance, and once tapped int,o could be used for other factors against a user. As an effective person said in the writing, "You should pay attention to what happens to us. You're next."
People allow control and restriction to the poor and those on assistance and in prison because a lower-class image gets set that a viewpoint is seen as a loss of rights and class status, so society does outcries it as they are undergoveerning forces by their circumstances. Not seeing the inherent human conditions and experience that could lead to all being affected like that sa a social credit control to keep people onine by fear of control and ability affected by social credit being lowered. Data could affect everything in our lives in the future, where it could drive people away from cities and to the woods, where there's no financial recognition for capital cities.
